## Our Project
## https://mersair-fp.glitch.me/
We created a way for students to find required books for their courses easily. A student
is able to create an account, add books that they own and are looking to trade, and search 
for books that they desire. If the book they need is a PDF, the link will be provided to 
them. However, if the book is physical, they will be able to see the user that has it and be 
able to message them in order to possibly trade for the book.

## Instructions
Just create an account, and you will have all the privileges you need to use our app! 

## Technologies
We use MongoDB to store our users, books, and messages. React routers are used to redirect
pages and make database requests. 

## Challenges
We encountered issues
